Hike Interview Experience ::

In Telephonic.

1. Implement Sigleton threadsafe
2. sum of x numbers = K (constant) find all x such number efficiently.

From Face2 Face *******
1st round ::

Ds :
1. Stack find minimum value at any point of time.
A. Keep one more stack with min value n do it. ( Asked me to do more efficiently bcoz if all elements in decreasing order u literally store all elements in Second Stack . Like use some mathematical formula to decrease the space complexity.)

2. Given a String find the biggest Palindrome inside that string.
  like "xyzabcbawerwererwerwabax"  => answer is abcba

A. My Approaches ::

a. Put All characters in LinkedhashMap with values as List<Integers>  like  ( X : value is 0 index , 20 index ...) . Then iterate over all the values of X & find whether a palindrome exists or not. If exists bigger put it in a variable n return it. Time Complexity is like O(n*n*n) => O(n3)

b. for every index try to go left one char n right one char increasingly until u find a bigger palindrome . Time Complexity O(n2)  Doubt : timecomplexity ...

c. He gave hint to use Dynamic programming with already done results in a map ... . One more is keep find 2 letter palindrome then increase it => 2 letter then add left , right letter of it as well n find the palindrome ...



3. Write code for Singleton.
4. Thread , Handler , IntentService ,

5. How do u implement IntentService from Service.
A. My code : But Problem is when no requests r running then thread will be blocked ( so no cpu ) but still IntentService is running forever. Can you optimize it.
what is better running it forever or killing n restarting it ??
class IntentService extends Service {

    Queue<ParentClass> queue;
    Thread intentThread;
    public void onCreate() {
       super.onCreate();
       queue = new LinkedList<ParentClass>();
       intentThread = new Thread( ()-> {
        while(true) {
         synchronized(queue) {
          while(queue.size == 0) {
             try {
                  queue.wait();
              } catch(InterruptedException e) {
                  e.printStackTrace();
              }
           }
              ParentClass object = queue.poll();
              // do some processing like setting data or computing some logic ...
              ParentResponse object = process(object);  // response has request.
              onHandleIntent(object);
         }
        }
       )
    }
    }

    public IBinder bind() {
         return null;
    }

    public synchronized void addRequest(ParentClass obj) {
        queue.add(obj);
        queue.notifyAll();
    }

    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent) {
            super.onStartCommand(intent);
            Bundle bundle = intent.getExtras();
            if(bundle != null ){
               ParentClass object = bundle.getSerialbleObject("abc");
               addRequest(object);
            }
            return STICKY_ ;
    }

    public void onHandleIntent(ParentResponse object) {

    }
}




******** Design Round **********

1. Show list of rows which has images into UI . High level design required?
A.  a. Image network retrieval with LinkedBlockingQueue with ThreadPoolExecutor
    b. Differnt level of Image Caching with caching Interface implemented by DiskLruCache , MemoryLRUcache .. Write a factory to get the
       appropriate implemenatation based on the request ....
    c. How do you make sure that u update UI row exactly of that rowId ... Write UML diagrams of all the things discussed.

2. Multiple Producer n consumer problem with synchronization only in a centralized class. How will you do that ??


******** 3rd Round **********

1. Print numbers sequentially , First Thread printing 1, 4,7 ...  , T2 printing 2,5,8... , T3 printing 3,6,9 ...-> output should be 1,2,3,4,
5,6,7,8,9....
A. Use modulus n numberOfThreads to solve this question.

2. In DataBase delete columns dynamically or statically ( after upgrade )?
A. For dynamically we need to get json from the server :

   DbTransaction close when doing  dynamically.
   For Delete : if the key is optional => Directly delete it ( May be read data of it n send to server once before deleting. )
   For Insert : if key is optional => See a default value is given => if default value given add column will put with default values  => if u want column data for every row then take primary key n based on that update values of the row.

   One more way is create a new table with differnt name n do all operations , then delete the original table n rename new table to old name
   to use the existing table with correctly.
